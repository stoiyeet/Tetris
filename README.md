# Tetris (SDL2, C++20)

A minimal Tetris implementation built using SDL2 and Clang++.

## Requirements

- C++20-compatible compiler (e.g. Clang++)
- SDL2 source files included directly in the codebase
- SDL2_ttf source files included directly in codebase
- Windows (x64)

Build the project by running:

```sh
./build.sh
```

You might have an easier time running the command directly in your terminal
